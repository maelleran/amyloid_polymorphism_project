### amyloid_polymorphism_project

amyloid_competition_plot.py contains a differencial equation solver and the code for the plots.

amyloid_competition_map_optimized contains the differencial equation solver, runs it for each value of k_2B and k_+B and plots the associated heatmap.

These files will be changed for a cleaner modular code at a later time.
